        <h1>Welcome to the Solano County Habitat Conservation Plan Geobrowser</h1><br>

		<p>The Solano County Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), administered by the Solano County Water Agency, provides a framework for promoting the conservation of biological diversity and the preservation of endangered species and their habitats consistent with the recognition of private property rights; provide for a healthy economic environment for the citizens, agriculture, and industries; and allow for ongoing maintenance and operation of public and private facilities in Solano County. The HCP streamlines the permitting process for planned development, infrastructure, and maintenance activities. The HCP also efficiently evaluates direct, indirect, and temporary impacts and mitigation requirements for Natural Communities, Covered, Species, Special Management Species, and their habitats.</p><br>
		<p>The HCP Geobrowser was developed with the goal of providing a simple way of understanding and visually processing the spatial data important to the implementation of the HCP. The Geobrowser will aid applicants in finding out what requirements a proposed project will have based on its location in the Solano County Plan Area and potential impacts to Natural Communities and Covered, Species.
