<h1>Welcome to the Solano County Habitat Conservation Plan Geobrowser</h1><br>

		<p>The Solano County Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), administered by the Solano County Water Agency, provides a framework for
		promoting the conservation of biological diversity and the preservation of endangered species and their habitats consistent with the recognition of private 
		property rights; provides for a healthy economic environment for the citizens, agriculture, and industries; and allows for ongoing maintenance and operation 
		of public and private facilities in Solano County.	The HCP also efficiently evaluates direct, indirect, and temporary impacts and mitigation requirements for Natural Communities, Covered Species, Special Management Species, and their habitats.</p><br>
		<p>The HCP Geobrowser was developed with the goal of providing a simple way of understanding and visually processing the spatial data important to the implementation of the HCP. 
		The Geobrowser will aid applicants in determining preliminary requirements a proposed project will have based on its location in the Solano County Plan Area and potential impacts to Natural
		Communities and Covered Species. </p>		<br>
